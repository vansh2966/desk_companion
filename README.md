# desk_companion
This is a desk_companion, more like a clock, which shows date and time, weather of ur room. will change is display according to the software i am using.eg it show the song name i am playing. the side display can show the the CPU and RAM usage of the pc. 

my main motive to make this was to see date and time, as i didnt had a desk clock, but as went through ideas, i thought i can multi use it according to my will.

its simple, it 4 touch sensor to control the display, made use it as a pomodoro timer. change the display wallpaper,etc
